Action - Source E-commerce Content (Choose ONE source initially):

Identify Source: Go to a major Malaysian e-commerce platform known to have Malay language content. Good candidates:

Lazada Malaysia (lazada.com.my): Check their Help Center/FAQ sections. They often have Malay versions.

Shopee Malaysia (shopee.com.my): Similar to Lazada, explore their Help Centre.

(Less likely but possible) A smaller local Malaysian e-commerce site focusing on specific products might have simpler FAQs.

Select Content: Find a specific FAQ page or a few related product category descriptions. Look for sections covering topics like:

Shipping (Penghantaran)

Payment (Bayaran)

Returns/Refunds (Pemulangan/Bayaran Balik)

Account Management (Akaun Saya)

How to Order (Cara Membuat Pesanan)

Copy Text: Copy 2-3 distinct paragraphs (or FAQ entries) of relevant Malay text from your chosen source. Paste this text into separate files or one consolidated file. This will form your context passages.

Example: You might copy the text explaining Lazada's standard shipping policy, another explaining Shopee's return process, etc. Keep it concise for now.

Action - Create Synthetic QA Pairs (The Core Task):

Objective: Based only on the text you just copied, manually create Question-Answer pairs in the SQuAD format. Aim for 10-20 high-quality pairs total for this initial MVP.

Process for Each Context Paragraph:

Read the Malay context paragraph carefully.

Write 3-5 clear questions in Malay whose answers are explicitly and directly stated within that paragraph.

For each question:

Identify the exact answer text span within the context paragraph. Copy it precisely.

Carefully count the starting character index (0-based) of that answer text within the context paragraph. (Spaces and punctuation count!). You can use an online character counter or a text editor's cursor position indicator.

Structure the Data: Create a CSV file named ecommerce_malay_qa.csv with these columns:

id (A unique ID for each QA pair, e.g., ecomm_qa_001, ecomm_qa_002)

context (The full Malay text paragraph you copied)

question (The Malay question you wrote)

answer_text (The exact Malay answer span you copied)

answer_start (The integer character index you found)

(Optional but good practice) title (e.g., "Lazada Shipping FAQ", "Shopee Return Policy") - helps organize if you use multiple sources.

Example Row in CSV:

id,context,question,answer_text,answer_start,title
ecomm_qa_001,"Tempoh penghantaran standard untuk Semenanjung Malaysia ialah 3-5 hari bekerja. Untuk Sabah & Sarawak, ia mungkin mengambil masa 5-7 hari bekerja.","Berapa lama tempoh penghantaran ke Sabah?",5-7 hari bekerja,111,"Lazada Shipping FAQ"
Use code with caution.
Csv
(Note: answer_start = 111 is hypothetical, you need to count carefully in your actual context).

Action - Load the Data (Code in Notebook):

Launch Jupyter Lab (jupyter lab in PowerShell if not already running).

Open your notebook (e.g., 01-FineTuning-QA.ipynb).

Place your ecommerce_malay_qa.csv file in the project directory.

Write/adapt the code to load this specific CSV and convert it into the Hugging Face Dataset format, ready for the SQuAD-style preprocessing function from the next step.

import pandas as pd
from datasets import Dataset, DatasetDict
import numpy as np # Good practice to import

# --- Load from CSV ---
data_filepath = 'ecommerce_malay_qa.csv'
print(f"Loading QA data from: {data_filepath}")
try:
    qa_df = pd.read_csv(data_filepath)
    print(f"Loaded {len(qa_df)} examples.")

    # --- IMPORTANT: Convert to SQuAD-like Dictionary Format ---
    # The preprocessing function expects 'answers' as a dictionary
    # containing 'text' (list) and 'answer_start' (list)
    def format_answers_for_squad(row):
        return {
            'answers': {
                'text': [str(row['answer_text'])], # Ensure text is string
                'answer_start': [int(row['answer_start'])] # Ensure start is integer
            }
        }

    # Apply this function to create the nested 'answers' structure
    # Note: This creates a list of dictionaries, we need to add it back correctly
    answers_list = qa_df.apply(format_answers_for_squad, axis=1).tolist()

    # Create Hugging Face Dataset, adding the 'answers' column correctly
    # First, create from the main DataFrame WITHOUT the answer text/start columns
    # Ensure 'id', 'context', 'question' columns exist in your CSV
    dataset_temp = Dataset.from_pandas(qa_df[['id', 'title', 'context', 'question']]) # Adjust columns based on your CSV

    # Add the formatted 'answers' column
    raw_dataset = dataset_temp.add_column("answers", answers_list)

    print("\nConverted to Hugging Face Dataset format:")
    print(raw_dataset)
    print("\nExample formatted data structure:")
    print(raw_dataset[0]) # Check the structure includes {'answers': {'text': [...], 'answer_start': [...]}}

except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"ERROR: Data file {data_filepath} not found.")
    raise
except KeyError as e:
    print(f"ERROR: Missing expected column in CSV: {e}. Ensure columns match code (id, title, context, question, answer_text, answer_start).")
    raise
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred during data loading/formatting: {e}")
    raise

# --- Split Data (Simple split for MVP) ---
# Use a small portion for evaluation, rest for training
# Important: Ensure min_eval_size doesn't exceed dataset size
total_size = len(raw_dataset)
min_eval_size = min(5, total_size) # Use up to 5 examples for eval, or fewer if dataset is smaller

if total_size <= min_eval_size: # Handle very small datasets
     print("Warning: Dataset too small for a dedicated eval split. Using entire dataset for train/eval.")
     train_dataset = raw_dataset
     eval_dataset = raw_dataset
else:
     # A simple split: use first N for eval, rest for train
     # eval_dataset = raw_dataset.select(range(min_eval_size))
     # train_dataset = raw_dataset.select(range(min_eval_size, total_size))
     # Or use train_test_split for randomness (better practice if > 10-15 samples)
     from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
     train_indices, eval_indices = train_test_split(
         range(total_size),
         test_size=max(0.1, min_eval_size/total_size), # Aim for ~10% or minimum eval size
         random_state=42 # For reproducibility
     )
     train_dataset = raw_dataset.select(train_indices)
     eval_dataset = raw_dataset.select(eval_indices)


# Create the final DatasetDict
dataset_dict = DatasetDict({'train': train_dataset, 'eval': eval_dataset})
print("\nCreated DatasetDict with train/eval splits:")
print(dataset_dict)
print(f"Training examples: {len(train_dataset)}")
print(f"Evaluation examples: {len(eval_dataset)}")
Use code with caution.
Python
AI Tool Usage: Use AI Bot for help finding character indices or translating short phrases if needed for your synthetic data. Use Copilot/Assistant for Pandas/Dataset formatting code.

Goal: Have your e-commerce specific Malay QA data loaded and structured correctly into a Hugging Face DatasetDict object (dataset_dict) with train and eval splits, ready for tokenization in the next step. Crucially, it must now contain the answers column formatted as a dictionary like {'text': ['answer string'], 'answer_start': [start_index]}.
