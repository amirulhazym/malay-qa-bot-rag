# Returns and Refunds Policy

At AuraCart, we strive to ensure your satisfaction with every purchase on AuraMall. This comprehensive policy outlines the conditions and procedures for returns and refunds, designed to be fair and transparent.

## 1. 30-Day Return Window

AuraCart offers a generous **30-day return window** from the date of delivery for most items purchased on AuraMall. This gives you ample time to inspect your purchase and decide if it meets your expectations.

*   **Eligibility Start Date:** The 30-day period begins on the date the item is marked as "Delivered" by our logistics partners.
*   **Request Deadline:** All return requests must be submitted within this 30-day period. Requests made after this window will generally not be accepted.

## 2. Conditions for Returns

For a return to be eligible, the item must meet specific conditions. Failure to meet these conditions may result in the rejection of your return request.

### General Conditions for All Returns

*   **Within the 30-Day Window:** The return request must be initiated within 30 days of delivery.
*   **Original Condition:** The item must be returned in its original, unused, and re-sellable condition. This includes all original packaging, tags, manuals, accessories, and free gifts or promotional items that came with the product.
*   **Reason for Return:** You must select a valid reason for return (e.g., defective item, wrong item, damaged during shipping, changed mind).
*   **Proof of Purchase:** A valid proof of purchase (e.g., AuraCart order number, invoice) is required.

### Specific Item Conditions

*   **Apparel & Fashion:** Must be unworn, unwashed, and have all original tags still attached. Undergarments, swimwear, and intimate apparel are generally non-returnable for hygiene reasons unless defective.
*   **Electronics & Gadgets:** Must be in original packaging with all accessories (cables, chargers, earphones, manuals). If the item is faulty, any user data must be wiped before returning. Items with clear signs of misuse or physical damage not present upon delivery will not be accepted.
*   **Health & Beauty Products:** Non-returnable if the seal is broken or if used, due to hygiene reasons. This includes cosmetics, skincare, and personal care items, unless defective or wrongly sent.
*   **Perishable/Groceries:** Generally non-returnable unless expired upon delivery, incorrect item, or clearly damaged/spoiled. Returns must be reported immediately upon receipt.
*   **Digital Products:** Non-returnable once redeemed or downloaded.
*   **Customized/Personalized Items:** Generally non-returnable unless defective or incorrect due to seller error.
*   **Items Marked "Non-Returnable":** Some specific items may be explicitly marked as non-returnable on their product page. Please check this before purchasing.

## 3. Step-by-Step Return Process

Follow these steps to initiate and complete a return request:

1.  **Initiate Return Request:**
    *   Log in to your AuraCart account.
    *   Go to "My Orders" and select the order containing the item you wish to return.
    *   Click on "Return/Refund" or "Request Return" next to the relevant item.
    *   Select the reason for your return from the provided options.
    *   Provide a clear description of the issue and upload supporting evidence (photos/videos) if applicable (e.g., for damaged or defective items).
2.  **Seller Review / AuraCart Review:**
    *   Your return request will be submitted to the seller for their review. For certain cases or if the seller doesn't respond promptly, AuraCart's dispute resolution team may step in to review.
    *   You may be contacted by the seller or AuraCart for further information or clarification.
3.  **Return Approval:**
    *   If your return request is approved, you will receive instructions on how to return the item. This typically includes a return shipping label or instructions for drop-off.
    *   **Packaging:** Securely package the item in its original packaging, ensuring all original contents are included.
    *   **Shipping:** Ship the item back using the provided label or method within the specified timeframe (usually 5-7 days after approval). AuraCart may cover return shipping costs for valid reasons (e.g., defective, wrong item). For "change of mind" returns, return shipping costs may be borne by the buyer.
4.  **Item Inspection:**
    *   Once the returned item is received by the seller or AuraCart, it will undergo an inspection to ensure it meets the return conditions.
5.  **Refund Processing:**
    *   If the item passes inspection, your refund will be processed according to the refund policy (see section 5). If it fails inspection, the item may be returned to you, and the refund denied.

## 4. AuraMall-Specific Policies

AuraMall, our premium marketplace, hosts official brands and authorized sellers. While the general AuraCart return policy applies, some AuraMall sellers may offer enhanced or specific return conditions.

*   **Official Store Policies:** Some official brand stores on AuraMall may have their own slightly modified return policies (e.g., longer return windows for specific items, direct exchange options). Always check the seller's specific policy on their AuraMall store page or the product description.
*   **Authenticity Guarantee:** All products on AuraMall are guaranteed to be authentic. If you receive an item from AuraMall that you believe is not authentic, your return will be prioritized, and a full refund will be issued upon verification.
*   **Enhanced Support:** Disputes for AuraMall purchases may receive expedited attention from AuraCart's customer support team.

## 5. Refund Processing Times

Once a refund is approved and processed, the time it takes for the funds to appear in your account depends on the original payment method.

### Refund Methods

*   **AuraWallet:** Refunds to your AuraWallet are the fastest, typically processed within **1-3 business days** after the returned item passes inspection.
*   **Credit/Debit Card:** Refunds to credit or debit cards usually take **5-10 business days** to appear on your statement, depending on your bank's processing times.
*   **Bank Transfer:** Refunds to bank accounts can take **3-7 business days** to reflect, depending on interbank processing.
*   **Cash on Delivery (COD):** For COD orders, refunds are typically issued to your AuraWallet or a specified bank account. This process can take **3-7 business days** after you provide your details and the return is approved.

### General Refund Notes

*   **Processing Start:** The refund processing time begins *after* the returned item has been successfully received and inspected by the seller or AuraCart, and the return is confirmed as eligible.
*   **Partial Refunds:** In some cases (e.g., only part of a bundled item is returned, or minor damage to packaging), a partial refund may be issued at AuraCart's discretion.
*   **Shipping Fees:** Original shipping fees are generally non-refundable unless the return is due to a seller error (e.g., defective, wrong item).
*   **Vouchers/AuraCoins:** If a voucher or AuraCoins were used, the monetary value of the voucher is typically not refunded, but the portion paid by other means (e.g., AuraWallet, card) will be. AuraCoins used may be re-credited to your account.
*   **Notification:** You will receive an email notification once your refund has been processed.
