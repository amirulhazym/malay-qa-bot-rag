Welcome to AuraCart! This document provides a comprehensive guide to managing your AuraCart account, from creation to security best practices.

## 1. Account Creation

Creating an AuraCart account is quick, free, and opens up a world of shopping possibilities.

### How to Create an AuraCart Account

To create a new account:
1.  **Download the AuraCart App** from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android), or visit the AuraCart website (www.auracart.com).
2.  On the homepage, click on "Sign Up" or "Register".
3.  You will be prompted to provide:
    *   Your mobile number (for verification) or email address.
    *   A secure password.
4.  A One-Time Password (OTP) will be sent to your registered mobile number or email address for verification. Enter this OTP into the AuraCart platform.
5.  Once verified, your AuraCart account is successfully created. You can now start exploring AuraMall and other features.

### Information Required for Registration

*   **Mobile Number or Email Address:** Essential for account verification and communication.
*   **Password:** Must be at least 8 characters long, including a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols for strong security.

2.  Click on "Login" or "Sign In".
3.  Enter your registered mobile number/email address and password.

### Troubleshooting Login Issues

*   **Incorrect Password:** If you receive an "incorrect password" error, double-check your input or proceed with a password reset (see section 3).
*   **Incorrect Username/Email:** Ensure you are using the mobile number or email address registered with your AuraCart account.
*   **Account Locked:** For security reasons, multiple failed login attempts may temporarily lock your account. Wait for the specified time or contact AuraCart Customer Support.
*   **No OTP Received:** Check your spam/junk folder for emails, or ensure your mobile number is correctly entered. You may request to resend the OTP after a short waiting period.

### How to Reset Your Password

1.  On the AuraCart login page, click on "Forgot Password?".

5.  You will then be prompted to create a new password. Choose a strong, unique password that you haven't used before.
6.  Confirm your new password and click "Reset Password". Your password will be updated immediately.

### Password Security Recommendations

*   **Strong Passwords:** Always use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

## 5. Account Security Best Practices

AuraCart is committed to protecting your account, but your vigilance is key.

### Strong Passwords and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

*   **Create Strong, Unique Passwords:** As mentioned in Section 3, use a mix of characters and avoid common words.
*   **Enable 2FA:** AuraCart strongly recommends enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for an added layer of security. This requires a verification code (sent to your phone or email) in addition to your password when logging in from a new device. You can enable 2FA in your "Security Settings" under "My Account".

### Recognizing and Avoiding Phishing Attempts

*   **Be Skeptical of Suspicious Emails/Messages:** AuraCart will never ask for your password, OTP, or full credit card details via email or unsolicited messages.
*   **Check Sender and Links:** Always verify the sender's email address and hover over links before clicking to ensure they lead to legitimate AuraCart domains (e.g., auracart.com).
*   **Report Suspected Phishing:** If you receive a suspicious communication purporting to be from AuraCart, please report it immediately to AuraCart Customer Support.

### Protecting Your Devices

*   **Keep Software Updated:** Ensure your operating system, web browser, and antivirus software are up-to-date on all devices used to access AuraCart.
*   **Secure Your Wi-Fi:** Use a strong, unique password for your home Wi-Fi network. Avoid accessing your account on public, unsecured Wi-Fi networks.
*   **Log Out After Use:** Especially on shared or public computers, always log out of your AuraCart account when you are finished.
*   **Monitor Account Activity:** Regularly check your order history and AuraWallet transactions for any suspicious activity. If you notice anything unusual, contact AuraCart Customer Support immediately.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure a secure and smooth experience on AuraCart.
