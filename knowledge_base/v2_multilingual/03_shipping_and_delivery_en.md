# Shipping and Delivery

This document provides a comprehensive guide to understanding AuraCart's shipping and delivery processes, from tracking your order to what to do if your item doesn't arrive as expected.

## 1. Order Tracking

Keeping track of your purchase is easy with AuraCart's integrated tracking system.

### How to Track Your Order

1.  **Log In to Your Account:** Access your AuraCart account through the app or website.
2.  **Navigate to "My Orders":** From your dashboard or profile, select "My Orders" or "Order History."
3.  **Select the Order:** Find the specific order you wish to track.
4.  **View Tracking Details:** Click on the order. You will see its current status and a "Track Shipment" button or direct tracking information. This will display detailed real-time updates from the logistics partner.

### Tracking Number and Updates

*   **Tracking Number:** A unique tracking number is automatically assigned to your order once it has been shipped by the seller. This number is accessible within your order details.
*   **Update Frequency:** Tracking information is updated regularly by the shipping carrier. Updates typically occur when the package reaches a new checkpoint (e.g., departing a sorting facility, arriving at a local hub, out for delivery).
*   **Information Provided:** The tracking page will show the current location of your package, estimated delivery date (if available), and a history of its journey.

## 2. Understanding Order Statuses

Your order will move through several statuses from purchase to delivery. Here's what each status means:

*   **Pending Payment:** Your order has been placed, but payment is still being processed or has not yet been completed.
*   **Processing / Awaiting Shipment:** Your payment has been confirmed, and the seller is preparing your order for shipment (e.g., picking, packing).
*   **Shipped / In Transit:** Your order has been handed over to the logistics partner and is on its way to your delivery address. You can typically begin tracking your order at this stage.
*   **Out for Delivery:** Your package has arrived at the local delivery hub and is with a courier for final delivery to your address.
*   **Delivered:** Your package has been successfully delivered to the specified address.
*   **Cancelled:** The order has been cancelled, either by the buyer, seller, or AuraCart. Reasons may include payment issues, item unavailability, or buyer request.
*   **Return Initiated:** The buyer has initiated a return request for the item.
*   **Return Approved / Rejected:** The return request has been reviewed and either approved or denied.
*   **Refunded:** A refund has been processed for your order, either due to a return, cancellation, or other resolution.

## 3. Estimated Delivery Times

Delivery times on AuraCart depend on several factors, including the seller's location, your delivery address, the type of product, and the chosen shipping method.

### Domestic Shipping (within the same country)

*   **Standard Shipping:**
    *   **Within Major Cities:** Typically 2-5 business days.
    *   **Inter-city / Remote Areas:** Typically 5-10 business days.
*   **Express Shipping (if available):**
    *   **Within Major Cities:** Often 1-2 business days.
*   **Factors Affecting Domestic Delivery:**
    *   **Seller Processing Time:** Time taken by the seller to prepare and hand over the item to the courier.
    *   **Logistics Partner Efficiency:** The speed of the selected courier service.
    *   **Public Holidays & Weekends:** Deliveries do not typically occur on public holidays or weekends, extending delivery times.
    *   **Unforeseen Circumstances:** Extreme weather, natural disasters, or major public events can cause delays.

### International Shipping (cross-border)

*   **Standard International Shipping:**
    *   Typically 7-25 business days, varying significantly by origin and destination country.
*   **Express International Shipping (if available):**
    *   Can be faster, often 3-7 business days, but at a higher cost.
*   **Factors Affecting International Delivery:**
    *   **Customs Clearance:** Packages must pass through customs in both the origin and destination countries, which can sometimes cause significant delays.
    *   **Import Duties & Taxes:** Buyers are responsible for any applicable import duties, taxes, or customs fees levied by the destination country's customs authorities. These are not included in the item price or shipping cost and may need to be paid upon delivery.
    *   **International Logistics:** The complexity of international shipping networks.

### General Notes on Delivery Times

*   **Business Days:** All estimated delivery times refer to business days (Monday to Friday, excluding public holidays).
*   **Estimates Only:** The provided delivery times are estimates. While AuraCart and its logistics partners strive to meet them, occasional delays can occur.
*   **Check Product Page:** Always refer to the estimated delivery time displayed on the product page and during checkout for the most accurate projection for your specific order.

## 4. What to Do If Your Item Doesn't Arrive

While rare, delays or lost packages can happen. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to proceed:

### Step 1: Check Tracking and Estimated Delivery Time

*   **Re-check "My Orders":** Go to your "My Orders" section and review the latest tracking updates.
*   **Compare with ETA:** Cross-reference the current status with the estimated delivery date provided at the time of purchase. It's common for packages to arrive slightly after the initial estimate, especially during peak seasons.

### Step 2: Verify Your Shipping Address

*   **Accuracy Check:** Go to "My Account" > "Addresses" and ensure the shipping address provided for the order is accurate and complete, including unit numbers, street names, postal codes, and contact numbers. An incorrect address is a common reason for delivery issues.

### Step 3: Check Around Your Delivery Location

*   **Neighbors/Family Members:** Ask if a neighbor or family member might have received the package on your behalf.
*   **Security/Building Management:** If you live in an apartment or gated community, check with your building's security or front desk.
*   **Safe Place:** Couriers sometimes leave packages in a safe, hidden spot near your door if direct handover isn't possible. Check common "safe places" like behind a plant or near a back entrance.

### Step 4: Contact AuraCart Customer Support

*   **When to Contact:** If the estimated delivery time has passed by a reasonable margin (e.g., 3-5 business days beyond the latest estimate for domestic, or 5-7 business days for international) and you have completed the checks above, it's time to contact AuraCart Customer Support.
*   **How to Contact:** Go to the "Customer Support" section of the AuraCart app or website and initiate a chat or submit a ticket, providing your order ID.
*   **Information to Provide:** Be ready to provide your order number, details of what you've already checked, and any relevant tracking information.

### Step 5: AuraCart's Buyer Protection

*   **Dispute Resolution:** AuraCart is committed to ensuring you receive your orders. If an item is genuinely lost in transit or was never delivered, AuraCart's Buyer Protection program will assist in investigating the issue with the seller and courier.
*   **Resolution:** Depending on the outcome of the investigation, you may be eligible for a full refund or a re-shipment of the item (subject to seller availability and policy).
*   **Timelines:** Investigations may take some time, but AuraCart will keep you updated throughout the process.
