# Advanced Seller Tools

This document provides an in-depth guide for AuraCart sellers to leverage advanced tools available in the Seller Center. Mastering these features will help you boost sales, optimize operations, and enhance customer satisfaction on AuraMall.

## 1. Using AuraCart's Marketing Tools

AuraCart provides a suite of marketing tools to help sellers increase product visibility, attract more buyers, and drive conversions.

### 1.1 Sponsored Product Ads

Sponsored Product Ads allow your products to appear prominently in search results and on relevant product pages, reaching buyers actively looking for items like yours.

*   **How They Work:** You bid on keywords relevant to your products. When a buyer searches for those keywords, your sponsored ad may appear at the top or in designated ad slots. You pay only when a buyer clicks on your ad (Cost-Per-Click).
*   **Campaign Setup:**
    1.  **Access:** In Seller Center, navigate to "Marketing Center" > "Sponsored Ads."
    2.  **Campaign Type:** Choose between "Auto Campaigns" (AuraCart's AI optimizes targeting) or "Manual Campaigns" (you select keywords and bids).
    3.  **Ad Group & Products:** Select the products you want to promote within an ad group.
    4.  **Budget & Duration:** Set your daily or total budget and campaign duration.
    5.  **Keywords & Bids (Manual):** For manual campaigns, research and select relevant keywords. Set competitive bids for each keyword. AuraCart provides keyword suggestions and bid estimates.
*   **Targeting Options:** Target specific demographics, locations, or even interests to reach the most relevant audience.
*   **Monitoring & Optimization:** Regularly review your ad performance (impressions, clicks, conversion rate, ROI) in the ad dashboard. Adjust bids, keywords, and budgets to optimize campaign effectiveness.

### 1.2 Vouchers and Promotions

Create various types of vouchers and promotions to incentivize purchases and drive sales for your AuraMall shop.

*   **Seller Vouchers:**
    *   **Creation:** In "Marketing Center," select "Vouchers." Define the discount type (fixed amount, percentage off), minimum spend, validity period, and products/categories it applies to.
    *   **Visibility:** Vouchers can be displayed on your shop page, product pages, or distributed via chat.
*   **Bundle Deals:** Offer discounts when buyers purchase a specific combination of your products (e.g., "Buy 2, Get 10% Off").
*   **Flash Sales:** Participate in AuraCart's platform-wide flash sales or create your own limited-time, high-discount promotions to create urgency and drive impulse buys. Ensure you have sufficient stock.
*   **Follower Vouchers:** Encourage new followers to your shop by offering exclusive vouchers when they follow your AuraMall store.
*   **Promotion Planning:** Plan your promotions strategically, aligning them with AuraCart's major campaign periods (e.g., 11.11, payday sales) for maximum impact.

### 1.3 Shop Decorations & Livestreaming (AuraLive)

Enhance your brand presence and engage buyers with rich content.

*   **Shop Decorations:** Customize your AuraMall store page using various templates and modules (banners, product grids, videos) to create an attractive and professional storefront that reflects your brand identity. A well-designed shop page encourages longer browsing times and higher conversion rates.
*   **AuraLive (Livestreaming):** Host live video sessions directly within the AuraCart app to showcase products, demonstrate usage, answer live questions, and offer exclusive flash deals.
    *   **Engagement:** Interact directly with potential buyers, building trust and rapport.
