# Shopping Guide

Welcome to AuraCart's comprehensive shopping guide! This document will walk you through the entire process of finding products, managing your shopping cart, applying discounts, and completing your purchase on AuraMall.

## 1. How to Search for Products

Finding what you need on AuraCart is easy and intuitive.

### Using the Search Bar

*   **Location:** The search bar is prominently located at the top of the AuraCart website or app interface.
*   **Keywords:** Enter relevant keywords for the product you are looking for (e.g., "smartphone," "wireless headphones," "men's t-shirt").
*   **Brand Names:** You can also search directly by brand name (e.g., "Samsung," "Nike").
*   **Product ID/SKU:** If you have a specific product ID or SKU, you can use that for precise searches.

### Browsing by Categories

*   **Access Categories:** On the AuraCart homepage or navigation menu, you will find a list of main product categories (e.g., Electronics, Fashion, Home & Living, Groceries).
*   **Sub-Categories:** Clicking on a main category will often reveal sub-categories to help you narrow down your search even further (e.g., Electronics > Mobile Phones > Android Phones).

### Applying Filters for Refined Search

Once you have searched or navigated to a category, you can refine your results using various filters:
*   **Price Range:** Set a minimum and maximum price.
*   **Brand:** Filter by specific brands available on AuraMall.
*   **Rating:** Show products with a certain average customer rating.
*   **Seller:** Filter by specific sellers or official stores.
*   **Shipping Options:** Filter by local or international shipping, or products eligible for fast delivery.
*   **Promotions:** See products eligible for specific promotions or discounts.
*   **Features/Specifications:** For electronics or specific items, filter by color, size, capacity, etc.

## 2. Using the Shopping Cart

The shopping cart is where you collect items you intend to purchase.

### Adding Items to Cart

1.  **Product Page:** Once you've found an item you want to buy, navigate to its product details page.
2.  **Select Options:** If applicable, choose variations like size, color, or quantity.
3.  **"Add to Cart" Button:** Click the "Add to Cart" button. A confirmation message will usually appear, and the item will be added to your cart.
4.  **Continue Shopping or View Cart:** You can continue browsing AuraMall or proceed to view your cart immediately.

### Reviewing and Modifying Cart Items

*   **Accessing Your Cart:** Click on the shopping cart icon (usually located at the top right corner of the page/app) to view your cart contents.
*   **Quantity Adjustment:** Change the quantity of any item by using the "+" and "-" buttons or directly inputting the desired number.
*   **Removing Items:** To remove an item, click the "Remove" or "Delete" button next to it.
*   **Saving for Later:** Some items may have an option to "Save for Later," which moves them out of your immediate cart but keeps them saved for future consideration.

## 3. Applying Promotional Vouchers and Discounts

AuraCart offers various ways to save money on your purchases.

### How to Apply a Voucher/Promo Code

1.  **Voucher Collection:** Vouchers can often be collected directly from promotion banners on the AuraCart homepage, product pages, or seller stores.
2.  **During Checkout:** When you proceed to the checkout page from your shopping cart, you will see a section for "Voucher Code" or "Apply Promo Code."
3.  **Enter Code:** If you have a specific code, type it accurately into the field and click "Apply."
4.  **Select Collected Voucher:** If you have collected a voucher, it will usually appear as an option to select from a list. Choose the voucher you wish to use.
5.  **Verify Discount:** The discount will be applied to your total, and you will see the updated price before confirming your order.

### Voucher Terms and Conditions

*   **Eligibility:** Vouchers often have specific eligibility criteria, such as minimum spend, specific products/categories, or certain payment methods (e.g., AuraWallet exclusive).
*   **Expiry Date:** All vouchers have an expiry date. Ensure you use them before they expire.
*   **Usage Limit:** Vouchers may be limited to one per customer or one per transaction.
*   **Non-Stackable:** Vouchers are generally not stackable, meaning you can typically only use one voucher per order. AuraCart automatically applies the best available discount if multiple are collected.
*   **Refunds:** If an order purchased with a voucher is cancelled or returned, the voucher amount is usually not refunded, but the paid amount will be. Check specific voucher terms.

## 4. The Complete Checkout Process

Once you're ready to buy, the checkout process is streamlined for convenience.

### Step 1: Review Your Order

*   After clicking "Checkout" from your shopping cart, you will be taken to an order summary page.
*   **Verify Items and Quantities:** Double-check all items and their quantities.
*   **Shipping Address:** Confirm your default shipping address or select/add a new one. Ensure all details are correct to avoid delivery issues.
*   **Select Shipping Option:** Choose your preferred shipping method if multiple options are available (e.g., standard, express).

### Step 2: Select Payment Method

AuraCart offers a variety of secure payment options:

*   **AuraWallet:** For fast, seamless payments and potential exclusive discounts/AuraCoin earning opportunities. Ensure your AuraWallet has sufficient balance or is linked to a top-up source.
*   **Credit/Debit Card:** Enter your card details securely. You may have the option to save your card for future purchases (encrypted).
*   **Bank Transfer:** Follow instructions for direct bank transfers; this method may require manual verification and take longer for order confirmation.
*   **Cash on Delivery (COD):** Available for selected products and locations. Please have the exact amount ready upon delivery.
*   **Installment Plans:** For higher-value items, AuraCart may offer installment options through partnered banks/providers.

### Step 3: Apply Vouchers and AuraCoins

*   On the checkout page, locate the "Voucher" or "AuraCoins" section.
*   **Voucher:** Select or input your desired voucher code (as detailed in section 3).
*   **AuraCoins:** If you have sufficient AuraCoins, you will see an option to apply them to your purchase. You can choose to use all available AuraCoins or a specific amount. Each AuraCoin has a specific monetary value which will be displayed (e.g., 100 AuraCoins = $1).

### Step 4: Place Order

*   **Review Final Total:** Before confirming, carefully review the final breakdown, including item costs, shipping fees, applied discounts, and the total amount due.
*   **Terms and Conditions:** By placing an order, you agree to AuraCart's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
*   **"Place Order" / "Confirm Payment" Button:** Click this button to finalize your purchase.
*   **Payment Gateway Redirection:** For card payments or bank transfers, you may be redirected to a secure payment gateway to complete the transaction.
*   **Order Confirmation:** Upon successful payment, you will receive an order confirmation on the screen, typically with an order ID. An email confirmation will also be sent to your registered email address.
