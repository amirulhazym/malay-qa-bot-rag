## 2. Listing Your First Product

Once your seller account is active, you can begin populating your AuraMall shop with products.

### Preparing Your Product Information

Before you start listing, gather the following for each product:
*   **High-Quality Images:** At least 3-5 clear, well-lit images showing the product from different angles, including lifestyle shots if possible. AuraCart recommends specific image dimensions and formats.
*   **Product Title:** A clear, concise, and keyword-rich title (e.g., "Brand Name Model Name - Key Feature - Color").
*   **Detailed Description:** A comprehensive description highlighting features, benefits, specifications, materials, and any relevant usage instructions. Use bullet points for readability.
*   **Category:** The most appropriate category and sub-category for your product.
*   **Price:** Your selling price.
*   **Stock/Inventory:** The number of units available.
*   **SKU (Stock Keeping Unit):** Your internal product identifier (optional but recommended).
*   **Variations (if applicable):** Sizes, colors, models, etc., and their respective stock and prices.
*   **Weight & Dimensions:** Accurate weight and dimensions of the packaged item, crucial for shipping cost calculation.
*   **Brand:** The brand of the product.
*   **Warranty Information:** Details about any warranty offered.

### Steps to List a Product

1.  **Log in to Seller Center:** Access your AuraCart Seller Center.
2.  **Navigate to "Products" > "Add New Product":** Locate the product management section.
3.  **Enter Basic Information:** Fill in the product title and select the correct category. AuraCart's system may suggest categories based on your title.
4.  **Upload Images:** Drag and drop or upload your high-quality product images.
5.  **Provide Details:** Fill in the product description, brand, weight, dimensions, and other specifications.
6.  **Set Pricing and Inventory:** Enter your selling price, original price (for showing discounts), and available stock.
7.  **Add Variations (if needed):** If your product has different sizes, colors, or styles, add them here with their respective prices and stock levels.
8.  **Shipping Information:** Confirm the package weight and dimensions. This helps AuraCart calculate shipping fees accurately.
9.  **Publish:** Review all details carefully. Once satisfied, click "Publish" or "Save and Publish." Your product will then appear on AuraMall, usually after a quick review.

## 3. Understanding Platform Fees

AuraCart operates on a transparent fee structure. It's crucial to understand these fees to price your products competitively and accurately calculate your profit margins.

### Types of Fees

*   **Commission Fee:**
    *   **Definition:** A percentage of the product's selling price (excluding shipping fees) charged by AuraCart for each successful sale.
    *   **Rate:** Commission rates vary by product category. High-value or fast-moving consumer goods may have lower commission, while specialized items might have higher rates. Specific rates are available in your Seller Center's "Fee Structure" section.
    *   **AuraMall vs. Regular Sellers:** Premium AuraMall sellers (official brands, authorized distributors) may have different commission structures or agreement terms.
*   **Payment Gateway Fee:**
    *   **Definition:** A small percentage fee charged by payment processors for handling online transactions (e.g., credit card, AuraWallet, bank transfers).
    *   **Rate:** Typically a small percentage (e.g., 1-3%) of the total transaction amount.
*   **Shipping Fee (Seller's Portion):**
    *   **Definition:** While buyers pay for shipping, sellers are often responsible for accurate package weight and dimensions. If these are incorrect, leading to undercharging the buyer, the difference may be charged back to the seller. AuraCart's integrated logistics ensure transparent shipping costs.
*   **Optional Service Fees:**
    *   **Promotional Tools:** Fees for using AuraCart's optional marketing and advertising tools (e.g., sponsored ads, voucher creation). These are elective.
    *   **Fulfillment Services:** If you opt for AuraCart's fulfillment services (e.g., warehousing, pick-and-pack), corresponding fees will apply.

### Fee Calculation Example (Illustrative)

*   Product Price: $100
*   Commission Rate: 5% = $5.00
*   Payment Gateway Fee: 2% of $100 = $2.00
*   **Net Payout to Seller:** $100 - $5.00 - $2.00 = $93.00 (Excluding shipping, if applicable)

### Payout Schedule

*   AuraCart typically processes seller payouts on a regular schedule (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly).
*   Payouts cover confirmed, delivered orders, usually after the buyer's return window has closed, to ensure funds are not clawed back due to returns/refunds.
*   You can view your transaction history and payout reports in your Seller Center.

## 4. Managing Orders

Efficient order management is crucial for good seller performance and customer satisfaction.

### New Order Notifications

*   **Real-time Alerts:** You will receive immediate notifications via the AuraCart Seller App, email, and within the Seller Center dashboard when a new order is placed.
*   **Dashboard Overview:** Your Seller Center dashboard provides a clear overview of new orders, pending shipments, and orders awaiting action.

### Order Processing Steps

1.  **Review Order Details:** Carefully check the product, quantity, buyer's shipping address, and any specific notes from the buyer.
2.  **Prepare Item:** Pick and carefully pack the item(s) according to AuraCart's packaging guidelines. Ensure adequate protection to prevent damage during transit.
3.  **Print Shipping Label:** Generate and print the shipping label directly from your Seller Center. This label contains tracking information and buyer address details.
4.  **Handover to Courier:**
    *   **Drop-off:** Drop off the packaged item at a designated AuraCart logistics partner's collection point.
    *   **Pickup:** Schedule a pickup from your location if this service is available in your area and for your shop.
5.  **Update Status:** Ensure the order status is updated to "Shipped" or "Ready for Pickup/Drop-off" in the Seller Center once the package is ready for courier collection. The tracking information will automatically be updated for the buyer.
6.  **Monitor Delivery:** Keep an eye on the tracking status until the order is marked as "Delivered."

### Dealing with Order Issues

*   **Cancellations:**
    *   **Buyer Initiated:** Buyers can cancel orders before shipment. If an order is cancelled, do not ship it.
    *   **Seller Initiated:** In rare cases (e.g., out of stock), you may need to cancel an order. Always communicate promptly with the buyer and select a valid reason. Excessive seller-initiated cancellations negatively impact your performance rating.
*   **Returns/Refunds:**
    *   **Notification:** You will be notified via Seller Center if a buyer initiates a return request.
    *   **Review and Respond:** Review the buyer's reason and evidence, then respond within the stipulated time frame (e.g., 2-3 business days) to approve, reject, or request more information.
    *   **Inspection:** Once the returned item is received, inspect it according to AuraCart's Returns Policy.
    *   **Action:** Process the refund or reject the return based on the inspection outcome and AuraCart policy.

By mastering these basics, you can effectively launch and grow your business on AuraCart, providing a positive experience for your customers.
