# Customer Support and Dispute Resolution

At AuraCart, we are committed to providing excellent customer service and ensuring a fair and efficient process for resolving any issues you may encounter. This document outlines how to contact AuraCart support, the process for resolving order-related disputes, and details our comprehensive Buyer/Seller Protection Program.

## 1. How to Contact AuraCart Support

AuraCart offers multiple channels for you to reach our customer support team.

### 1.1 In-App / Website Help Center

*   **Self-Service:** Our Help Center, accessible through the AuraCart app or website, contains a vast library of frequently asked questions (FAQs) and knowledge base articles (like this one!). Many common queries can be resolved here directly.
*   **Searching for Answers:** Use the search bar within the Help Center to find articles related to your specific issue (e.g., "return status," "AuraWallet top-up").

### 1.2 Live Chat Support

*   **Availability:** Live chat is typically the fastest way to get assistance from a customer service representative. It's available during specific operating hours, which can be found in the Help Center.
*   **Access:** Look for the "Chat with Us" or "Contact Support" button, usually found within the Help Center or "My Account" section of the app/website.
*   **Connecting with an Agent:** You may first interact with a chatbot that can answer basic questions or direct you to the relevant articles. If your issue requires human assistance, the chatbot will guide you to connect with a live agent.
*   **Information to Prepare:** Have your order ID, relevant screenshots, or specific details of your issue ready to expedite the process.

### 1.3 Email Support

*   **Non-Urgent Issues:** For less urgent matters or inquiries that require detailed explanations and attachments, email support is available.
*   **How to Email:** Submit a ticket or send an email through the "Contact Us" form in the Help Center.
*   **Response Time:** Email responses typically take 24-48 business hours, depending on query volume.
*   **Include Details:** Always include your AuraCart registered email/phone, order ID (if applicable), and a clear, detailed description of your issue.

### 1.4 Social Media (for General Inquiries)

*   **Community Engagement:** AuraCart's official social media channels can be used for general inquiries, announcements, and community engagement.
*   **Avoid Sensitive Information:** Do not share personal or sensitive account details via social media DMs. For specific account or order issues, always use the in-app/website chat or email support for security reasons.

## 2. Process for Resolving Issues with Orders

AuraCart has a structured process for handling order-related issues, ensuring fairness for both buyers and sellers.

### 2.1 Before Initiating a Formal Dispute

*   **Contact the Seller First (for non-delivery/item issues):** For issues like a missing item, wrong product received, or a damaged item, it's often best to try and communicate directly with the seller via AuraCart's chat function first. Many issues can be quickly resolved through direct communication.
*   **Provide Evidence:** Always provide clear evidence (photos, videos) if the issue is related to product condition (e.g., damaged, defective, wrong item).

### 2.2 Initiating a Return/Refund Request

If direct communication with the seller doesn't resolve the issue, or if the issue is related to product quality/condition, proceed with a formal return/refund request.

1.  **Access "My Orders":** Log in to your AuraCart account and go to "My Orders."
2.  **Select Order & Item:** Find the specific order and item you have an issue with.
3.  **Click "Return/Refund":** Select the option to initiate a return or refund request.
4.  **Choose Reason & Provide Details:** Select the most appropriate reason for your request (e.g., "Received damaged item," "Missing item," "Product not as described"). Provide a detailed explanation of the problem and upload all relevant supporting evidence (photos, videos, chat logs if applicable).
5.  **Submit Request:** Confirm and submit your request.

### 2.3 Seller's Response and AuraCart Intervention

*   **Seller Review:** The seller will be notified of your request and given a timeframe (e.g., 2-3 business days) to review it and propose a solution (e.g., approve return, offer partial refund, reject).
*   **AuraCart Intervention (Dispute Resolution):**
    *   **Automatic Escalation:** If the seller fails to respond within the stipulated time, or if the buyer and seller cannot agree on a resolution, the case will automatically escalate to AuraCart's dispute resolution team.
    *   **Manual Escalation:** You can also manually escalate a case to AuraCart if you believe the seller's response is unsatisfactory or unreasonable, and the option becomes available after the initial communication period.
    *   **Investigation:** AuraCart's team will thoroughly review all evidence provided by both the buyer and the seller. They may also contact either party for further clarification or request additional evidence.
    *   **Decision:** Based on the investigation and AuraCart's policies, a final decision will be made. This decision is binding for both parties. Possible outcomes include:
        *   Full refund to the buyer.
        *   Partial refund to the buyer.
        *   Return of the item for a refund.
        *   Rejection of the refund/return request.

### 2.4 Resolution and Follow-Up

*   **Refund Processing:** If a refund is approved, it will be processed according to AuraCart's Returns and Refunds Policy (see `04_returns_and_refunds_en.md` for details on processing times).
*   **Return Instructions:** If a return is required, clear instructions on how to ship the item back will be provided.
*   **Communication:** You will receive notifications on the progress and final resolution of your dispute.

## 3. Buyer and Seller Protection Program

AuraCart's Buyer/Seller Protection Program is designed to ensure a fair and secure trading environment for everyone on AuraMall.

### 3.1 Buyer Protection

AuraCart is committed to protecting buyers from fraudulent sellers and ensuring they receive what they paid for.

*   **Authenticity Guarantee:** AuraMall products are guaranteed to be authentic. If a buyer receives a counterfeit item from an AuraMall seller, they are entitled to a full refund.
*   **Money-Back Guarantee:** Buyers are protected by a money-back guarantee if:
    *   The item does not arrive within the estimated delivery time frame.
    *   The item received is significantly not as described (e.g., wrong item, defective, damaged).
    *   The item received is incomplete (missing parts/accessories).
*   **Secure Payment System:** AuraCart holds payments in escrow until the buyer confirms satisfactory receipt of the item, or the return window has passed. Funds are only released to the seller after successful delivery and buyer satisfaction.
*   **Dispute Resolution Support:** Access to AuraCart's dispute resolution team to mediate and resolve conflicts between buyers and sellers.
*   **Data Security:** Protection of personal and payment information through encryption and secure protocols.

### 3.2 Seller Protection

AuraCart also protects sellers from fraudulent buyers and ensures fair play.

*   **Proof of Delivery:** Sellers are protected against "item not received" claims when valid proof of delivery (tracking information provided by AuraCart's logistics partners) is available.
*   **Return Policy Enforcement:** AuraCart enforces its return policy, ensuring that items returned by buyers meet the required conditions (e.g., original condition, all parts included).
*   **Protection Against Abusive Returns:** Sellers are protected against buyers who abuse the return policy (e.g., returning a different item, significant damage not present at delivery, buyer-caused damage).
*   **Secured Payouts:** Funds are released to sellers only after a successful transaction, minimizing risk from fraudulent payments.
*   **Dispute Resolution Support:** Access to AuraCart's dispute resolution team to mediate conflicts and review evidence from both sides.
*   **Community Guidelines:** Protection from abusive or inappropriate content/communication from buyers.

By leveraging these support channels and understanding the dispute resolution process, you can navigate any challenges confidently, knowing that AuraCart is dedicated to a secure and satisfactory experience for all users.
