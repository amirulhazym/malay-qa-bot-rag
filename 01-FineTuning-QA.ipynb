This is often efficient. test_size=0.2 asked for 20% of indices for the evaluation set. random_state=42 ensures the split is the same every time the code is run (reproducibility). It returned two lists: train_indices and eval_indices.\n",

    "\n",
    "Why It Was Done (Justification & Theory):\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Evaluation: It is absolutely critical in machine learning to evaluate your model's performance on data it has never seen during training. Training and evaluating on the same data gives an overly optimistic view and doesn't reflect how the model will perform on new, real-world examples (overfitting).\n",

    "Standard Practice: Splitting data into dedicated training and evaluation (or validation/test) sets is a fundamental step in the ML workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "DatasetDict: Using DatasetDict is the standard way to organize multiple splits within the Hugging Face ecosystem, making it easy to pass them to the Trainer.\n",
